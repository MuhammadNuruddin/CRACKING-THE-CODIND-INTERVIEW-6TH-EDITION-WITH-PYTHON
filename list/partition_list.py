"""
Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list the values of x only need
to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
"right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input:3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
Output:3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

SOLUTION
If this were an array, we would need to be careful about how we shifted elements. Array shifts are very
expensive.
However, in a linked list, the situation is much easier. Rather than shifting and swapping elements, we can
actually create two different linked lists: one for elements less than x, and one for elements greater than or
equal to x.
We iterate through the linked list, inserting elements into our before list or our after list. Once we reach
the end of the linked list and have completed this splitting, we merge the two lists.
This approach is mostly "stable" in that elements stay in their original order, other than the necessary moveÂ­
ment around the partition. The code below implements this approach.
