Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2.That is, 912.

Follow Up
Part B is conceptually the same (recurse, carry the excess), but has some additional complications when it
comes to implementation:
1. One list may be shorter than the other, and we cannot handle this "on the flY:' For example, suppose we
were adding (1 -> 2 -> 3-> 4) and (5-> 6-> 7). We need to know that the 5 should be"matched"with the
2, not the 1. We can accomplish this by comparing the lengths of the lists in the beginning and padding
the shorter list with zeros.
2. In the first part, successive results were added to the tail (i.e., passed forward). This meant that the recurÂ­
sive call would be passed the carry, and would return the result (which is then appended to the tail). In
this case, however, results are added to the head (i.e., passed backward). The recursive call must return
the result, as before, as well as the carry. This is not terribly challenging to implement, but it is more
cumbersome. We can solve this issue by creating a wrapper class called Partial Sum.
